<p>I am <font color="#884EA0"><b>Lai Tang</b></font> from China, Shanghai. I like to go shopping with my friends on weekends, have supper and karaoke after exams. Now I'm a freshman at Miami Oxford.</p>
 <h1><font color="#C0392B">Why I want to enroll?</font></h1>
<p>First of all, it is the name of the Department that attracts me, Department of Emerging <font color="#2E86C1"><b>Technology</b></font> in <font color="#28B463"><b>Business</b></font> + <font color="#FF5733"><b>Design</b></font>. 
 <p>With the development of the times, <font color="#2E86C1"><b>technology</b></font> has become indispensable. We rely on it increasingly, such as mobile payment and electronic door lock. Under such a trend, we can also know the professions related to technology have good prospects for development.
<p><font color="#28B463"><b>Business</b></font> as a hot classic discipline in the University. In my mind, it's directly related to money. And after browsing program requirements, I found that what we need to learn is to analyze users and social media marketing, which is exactly what I am interested in of business.</p>
<p><font color="#FF5733"><b>Design</b></font> is like a finishing touch, adding sensuality to an ordinary object. When most of us arenâ€™t struggling to make a living, rich design is one of the things we aspire to. For example, Apple sells more phones than any other brand, because regardless from the system, the outward appearance as well as the shops all has conforms to the populace taste design feeling. As a person who loves designed objects, I also would like to have my own work. In addition, I am surrounded by people including myself who always think I am a creative and energetic person and many of my family and friends are engaged in design or painting related work.</p>
